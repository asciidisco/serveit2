# serveit2
Quick &amp; dirty static HTTP2 server

## Installation

```
npm i serveit2 -g
```

## Usage

```
serveit2 [port]
```

> Default port is 5000

It will spin up a HTTP2 server in the current working directory

## Note

As said, this is a Quick & Dirty hack. You´re not able to play around with server push (which is an important feature of HTTP2). I´ll probably add this via a config file later on.
